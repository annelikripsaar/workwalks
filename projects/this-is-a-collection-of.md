This is a collection of gutter shadows, scanlines, censorship, transparencies, post-it notes, scribbles, scanning beds, specks of dust and debris. It is also an archive of various reading materials handed out to me during my bachelor studies at the Department of Graphic Design, Estonian Academy of Arts.\
While reading these (scanned and photocopied) texts, I was mesmerized by certain incidental aesthetic qualities â€“ the gutter shadows, scanlines etc. and how the document was personalised.\
They show traces of human interaction, of someone, mostly a teacher, underlining a sentence or two, making comments and actually going through the trouble of scanning the text for students.\
The project displays acts of care that lie behind sharing information in a clumsy scanline.
